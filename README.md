## Deploy Secure Static Web Apps on AWS

Securing static web apps is a complex challenge for many organizations. While there is no one size fits all approach, there are services and features within AWS that you can utilize to get a head start on your web app security journey. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) can protect your web app against bots that may compromise security or consume excessive resources. Additionally, Amazon CloudFront Functions can add HTTP security headers that limit requests from the client. This APG provides an AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) construct with secure defaults to simplify the infrastructure for a secure static web app. The construct uses Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and Amazon Route 53.

See the associated Amazon Prescriptive Guidance (APG) Pattern [here](https://apg-library.amazonaws.com/content/9ed9140c-a1d6-49ac-8aba-8bd533fa4ce2) for further information.
